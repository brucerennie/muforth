<p>muforth is a small, simple, fast, indirect-threaded code (ITC) Forth intended for use as a cross-compiler for microcontrollers and other embedded devices. It is written in C and its core is very portable. Because of its Forth nature, it is naturally extensible, scriptable, and customizable.</p>
<p>It is very well-suited to interactive coding, debugging, and exploration, and is a great tool for bringing up new hardware.</p>
<p>It has support &ndash; in varying degrees of completeness &ndash; for the following architectures:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/ARM/v5">ARMv5</a> (originally targeting an ARM AEB-1 board running an ARM7DI processor)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/ARM/v6-m">ARMv6-m</a> (aka Cortex-M0/M0+)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/ARM/v7-m">ARMv7-m</a> (aka Cortex-M3/M4)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/AVR">AVR</a> (Atmel)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/HC08">HC08 and HCS08</a> (Motorola/Freescale/NXP)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/MSP430">MSP430</a> (TI)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/PIC18">PIC18</a> (Microchip)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/RISC-V">RISC-V</a> (initially targeting the SiFive FE310)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-yet-another-forth"><a href="#why-yet-another-forth">Why yet another Forth?</a></h2>
<p>I initially wrote muforth because I wanted to try out some implementation ideas. Today there is very little that distinguishes muforth from fig-FORTH &ndash; but the differences go rather deep.</p>
<p>Its implementation is no longer the point. Its sole reason for existing is to be a cross/meta/target-compiler for <em>other</em> Forths, and their implementations are in no way tied to muforth&rsquo;s.</p>
<h2 id="get-the-source"><a href="#get-the-source">Get the source</a></h2>
<p>The code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/">Github</a>. It&rsquo;s super easy to build; just look at <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/blob/master/BUILDING">BUILDING</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/blob/master/LICENSE">BSD licensed</a>, so do what you want with it! I&rsquo;d love to <a href="mailto:%6d%75%66%6f%72%74%68%2b%75%73%65%73%40%6e%69%6d%62%6c%65%6d%61%63%68%69%6e%65%73%2e%63%6f%6d?subject=%5bmuforth%5d%20muforth%3a%20a%20simple%20ITC%20Forth">hear about innovative or unusual uses</a> of muforth.</p>
<h2 id="documentation"><a href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>The code &ndash; both the <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/src/">C code that implements the Forth virtual machine</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/">muforth code that does everything else</a> &ndash; is carefully and in some cases extensively (even obsessively!) commented. Right now your best source of documentation is the code! Luckily for you, there isn&rsquo;t that much, so reading it is actually possible. That&rsquo;s part of the point of muforth; I want it to be a <a href="https://www.nimblemachines.com/convivial-tool/">convivial tool</a>.</p>
<p>The key to the system is the Forth code that muforth reads when it first starts: <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/blob/master/mu/startup.mu4">startup.mu4</a>. You&rsquo;ll learn a <em>lot</em> by reading this!</p>
<p>Look in <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target">mu/target/</a> to find a target that interests you. There is generally a mu/target/&lt;target>/build.mu4 that loads the cross-build environment. Use it as an &ldquo;index&rdquo; to find the assembler, disassembler, meta-compiler, kernel, and other key pieces of code.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The state of muforth&rsquo;s documentation will get much better! Especially if I <a href="mailto:%6d%75%66%6f%72%74%68%2b%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%61%74%69%6f%6e%40%6e%69%6d%62%6c%65%6d%61%63%68%69%6e%65%73%2e%63%6f%6d?subject=%5bmuforth%5d%20muforth%3a%20a%20simple%20ITC%20Forth">hear feedback</a> about how terrible it is. ;-)</p>

<p>The original <a href="/readme/">README</a> &ndash; though outdated in many ways &ndash; is a good introduction to why I wrote muforth and what I was trying to achieve. It describes the native-code compiler version of the system. That, and a few other things &ndash; notably create/does, the tokeniser, and the <em>lack</em> of tail-recursion in the threaded version &ndash; have changed since the <a href="/readme/">README</a> was written, but much of it is still true, applicable, and hopefully of interest.</p>
<h2 id="talks"><a href="#talks">Talks</a></h2>
<p>In March 2008 I gave a <a href="https://vimeo.com/859408">talk</a> about bootstrapping, muforth, and <a href="https://www.nimblemachines.com/convivial-tool/">convivial tools</a>.</p>
<p>Warning: I wave my arms around a lot, and the audio and video quality isn&rsquo;t that great, but you might find it interesting, or at least amusing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to see my slides. If you want to &ldquo;follow along&rdquo;, <a href="/-/2008-mar-30-PNCA.txt">download my slides</a>, and use <code>less</code> to view them &ndash; ideally in a text window that is about 31 lines high &ndash; like so:</p>
<pre>
  less -G 2008-mar-30-PNCA.txt
</pre>
<p>Use <code>/^===</code> to get to the second page, and <code>n</code> to page forward after that.</p>
